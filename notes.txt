urls: 
passing request into a function makes it a view. 

models 
==========
blank=True
This is for django to know that we can, 
submit forms with nothing in them. 
null=true, is to let database know it can be null. 

by default django will create id for us so no need to define id field in models. 

 
-----

after models, makemigrations and migrate, 
but still wont be able to see in admin since
django-admin is not directly connected to the db. 

for this, 
register models in admin file. 

django models naming conventions 
table is named singular (project) and django adds 's'

can change it using meta class, verbose attr
-----------

many to many 
tag can be connected to multiple models, 
hence the relationship (project to Tag) is not defined in tag model but in Project model
