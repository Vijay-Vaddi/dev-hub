models 
==========
blank=True
This is for django to know that we can, 
to submit forms with nothing in them. 
null=true, is to let database know it can be null. 

by default id can be blank? 
 
-----

after models, makemigrations and migrate, 
but still wont be able to see in admin since
django-admin is not directly connected to the db. 

for this, 
register models in admin file. 

django models naming conventions 
table is named singular (project) and django adds 's'

can change it using meta class, verbose attr
