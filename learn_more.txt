models:
db relationships:
    on_delete options (Cascade, setnull) etc

diff between char/textfield
why char is given length but not textfield. 

--------
query sets.
Model.objects.get(), filter, etc.. 
learn and explore all the options available

---------

difference between object retured when using get() and filter()
child_set not available when used with filter. 

ans: filter returns a query set, and get returns a single object
have have to do list conversion and parsing []

obj = Project.objects.filter(title__icontains='vendor')
list(obj.review_set.all()).value()[0].body --> select first review obj, then .body as attribute to get its value
